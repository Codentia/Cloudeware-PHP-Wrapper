1. To use in .html, server needs to be configured to run html as php - this can be set up in htaccess by adding the handler (we may need to automate this for users)


Need a way for 'core' to report it's version, so that we know when an upgrade is needed
cos e.g if we add new type of section
core script will have to be updated
and we want to semi-automate that
it also has to know e.g
you are on 1.1 latest is 2.7
is a) upgrade REQUIRED
b) is it compatible or do you need to redo your snippets
could send an md5 up to ensure script is valid

im thinking it should include an md5 in the call
so its md5(of version# + script details), partskey
and if the md5 isnt valid we know they've either been compromised
or tried to edit the script
etc


parts install as part of rig?

add proper file headers

test files which cloudeware can use to prove php is working (htm, php - test for addheader in htaccess)

md5 might not be ideal for updates - maybe crc32 as no risk of collision
